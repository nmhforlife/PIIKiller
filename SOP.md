Purpose
This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) outlines the troubleshooting steps for resolving issues related to [Specific Feature/Functionality of mParticle].
An SOP aims to:
Improve efficiency: By providing a documented process, agents can resolve issues faster and more consistently.
Maintain quality: Following a standardized approach ensures a high level of service for all customers encountering this issue.
Facilitate knowledge transfer: New agents can learn the troubleshooting process quickly and effectively.
Scenario(s)
This SOP applies to the following scenarios:
Customers experiencing [Specific Error Message] when using [Specific Feature/Functionality].
Customers reporting unexpected behavior related to [Specific Feature/Functionality].
Customers cannot achieve the desired outcome using [Specific Feature/Functionality].
Causes(s)
A list of potential causes for the issue. This may include:
Configuration Errors: Incorrect settings within the mParticle platform.
Integration Issues: Problems with integrating mParticle and a customer's other systems.
Data Errors: Inaccurate or incomplete data being sent to mParticle.
System Bugs: Issues within the mParticle platform itself (less common).
Steps to Investigate
The steps that the TSE will take to investigate the issue ascend in complexity and require more tools. We want to start with the simplest or most likely solution and end with the most complex solution.
Gather Information:
Collect details from the customer about the issue, including error messages, screenshots (if applicable), and steps to reproduce.
Review the customer's mParticle account configuration for the relevant feature/functionality.
Check the mParticle status page for any known service disruptions.
Basic Troubleshooting:
Configuration Errors: Review configuration settings for accuracy and completeness.
Verification: the customer is using a supported platform or device version.
Integration Issues: Verify the customer's integration is set up correctly according to the mParticle documentation.
Try to reproduce the issue in your workspace
Advanced Troubleshooting:
If basic troubleshooting fails, perform more in-depth checks based on the potential causes. This step tends to leverage our tooling vs. the UI
Data Errors: Analyze the data sent to mParticle for inconsistencies or missing values. 
SUMO, Looker, Chronospere, Observe, etc.
Engage Product/Engineering (if necessary):
If the issue cannot be resolved with the above steps, escalate the issue to the Product or Engineering team for further investigation via a JIRA.
Provide a detailed report of the troubleshooting steps taken and the collected information.
